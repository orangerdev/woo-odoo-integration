# Copilot Instructions for WooCommerce Odoo Integration Plugin

When working on this WordPress plugin, follow these strict rules:

## Architecture Rules

1. **Hook Management**: ALL WordPress hooks (add_action, add_filter) MUST only be registered in `includes/class-woo-odoo-integration.php`
2. **File Organization**:
   - Backend/Admin classes → `admin/` folder only
   - Frontend/Public classes → `public/` folder only
   - Core utilities → `includes/` folder
3. **Clean Code**: Follow WordPress Coding Standards and PSR-4
4. **Documentation**: Every function/class needs complete PHPDoc with hooks, parameters, and return types

## Code Generation Rules

- Never add hooks directly in admin or public classes
- Always use WordPress APIs (no direct SQL)
- Include proper sanitization and nonce verification
- Use WP_Error for error handling
- Follow the documentation template exactly

## Before suggesting any code:

1. Check if it follows the hook management rule
2. Verify correct folder placement
3. Ensure proper documentation is included
4. Confirm WordPress security best practices
